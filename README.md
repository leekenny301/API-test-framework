## Notes
1. The codes are written in Java using IntelliJ. I am unaware if other IDEs (ie. Eclipse) can open this project properly.

## How to run:
1. If you use IntelliJ, you can simply open up the terminal from within the application. Just hit `Alt + F12` to bring it up.
    - (Skip this step if IntelliJ is used) Alternatively, open Command Prompt and navigate to the where the project is stored.
2. Make sure you are in the correct directory ie. `...\API-test-framework`
3. Run the command `gradlew test`
    - Alternatively, you can open `build.gradle` file in the project and run the `test` section
